# Managing Inner Source Projects book

This repository contains the Markdown files needed to build the whole Managing
Inner Source Projects book.
This is intended to bring from a managerial perspective the several aspects needed
when introducing inner source methodologies into enterprises.


This book is a work in progress process where anyone is more than welcome to contribute
in any possible way. Ideas, comments, typos, full paragraphs or sections would be
great. This repository aims at bringing specialized knowledge from the industry
within this respect in a way that this is useful for third parties. For this, we are
actively looking for reviewers that can help in this process.
For those that have already contributed to the book, thanks a lot!

You can find more information about the process in the [contributing section](https://github.com/dicortazar/managing-inner-source-projects/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## References

For further reading, we encourage you to participate in the [Inner Source Commons site](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/)
funded by PayPal where dozens of companies are already sharing experiences and working to
understand all of this. It is a great place to understand how others are facing this
new methodology as we are all learning from this incipient process.

And finally, if you're interested in participating from a survey perspective and share
your insights about this within your organization, please have a look at the
[Inner Source Survey](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/assets/files/InnerSourceCommonsSurvey2016.pdf).


## Acknowledgements

Each chapter in the book is authored and reviewed by different people. That information can
be found at the beginning of each chapter. This initiative is fostered by [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com)
although given some technical issues, we finally decided to open this under a personal
repository.
