# Managing InnerSource Projects book

<img src="managing-innersource-projects-cover.jpg" title="Managing InnerSource Projects">

This book is intended to bring, from a managerial perspective, the several aspects needed
when introducing InnerSource methodologies into enterprises.

This book is a work in progress process where anyone is more than welcome to contribute
in any possible way. Ideas, comments, typos, full paragraphs or sections would be
great. This repository aims at bringing specialized knowledge from the industry
within this respect in a way that this is useful for third parties. For this, we are
actively looking for reviewers that can help in this process.
For those that have already contributed to the book, thanks a lot!

You can find more information about the process in the [contributing section](https://github.com/dicortazar/managing-inner-source-projects/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Who is fostering this initiative?

Bitergia, as neutral actor in the software development analytics field aims at
sharing the knowledge acquire during the last years. This book is currently focused on its main areas of expertise such as the usual metrics and KPI's to use,
the methodology, the metrics strategy around your general InnerSource strategy 
or the infrastructure needed to have a successful InnerSource
journey within your company.

This book is open to anyone interested in InnerSource, either you are 
applying this and you want to share your use case or you have successfully 
applied InnerSource in your internal software development process.

## How Do We Structure Goals, Questions, and Metrics?

Review the [Goal-Question-Metric Approach](./measuring/gqm.md) to further understand how we structure goals, questions, and metrics.

We document each goal in a separate folder in the [measuring](./measuring) directory. Goals link to relevant questions and metrics in the same directory.

*Examples:*

* [Example Goal](./measuring/gqm_example/gqm_example_goal.md)
* [Example Question](./measuring/gqm_example/gqm_example_question.md)
* [Example Metric](./measuring/gqm_example/gqm_example_metric.md)

We interconnect our goals, questions, and metrics. This approach not only expands our documentation of these aspects but also keeps it well-organized.

For further reading, we encourage you to participate in the [InnerSource Commons site](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/)
funded by PayPal where dozens of companies are already sharing experiences and working to
understand all of this. It is a great place to understand how others are facing this
new methodology as we are all learning from this incipient process.

And finally, if you're interested in participating from a survey perspective and share
your insights about this within your organization, please have a look at the
[InnerSource Survey](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/assets/files/InnerSourceCommonsSurvey2016.pdf).
