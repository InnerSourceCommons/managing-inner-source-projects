# Managing InnerSource Projects book

![Managing InnerSource Projects](managing-innersource-projects-cover.jpg)

This book is intended to bring, from a managerial perspective, the several aspects needed
when introducing InnerSource methodologies into enterprises.

This book is a work in progress process where anyone is more than welcome to contribute
in any possible way. Ideas, comments, typos, full paragraphs or sections would be
great. This repository aims at bringing specialized knowledge from the industry
within this respect in a way that this is useful for third parties. For this, we are
actively looking for reviewers that can help in this process.
For those that have already contributed to the book, thanks a lot!

You can find more information about the process in the [contributing section](https://github.com/dicortazar/managing-inner-source-projects/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Who is fostering this initiative?

We thank [Bitergia] (especially José Manrique López and Daniel Izquierdo) for starting this book and seeding it with its main areas of expertise such as the usual metrics and KPI's to use,
the methodology, the metrics strategy around your general InnerSource strategy 
and the infrastructure needed to have a successful InnerSource
journey within a company.

The book is now managed by the [ISPO Working Group].
It is open for use and contribution by anyone interested in InnerSource.
Come join us and contribute!

## How Do We Structure Goals, Questions, and Metrics?

Review the [Goal-Question-Metric Approach](./measuring/gqm.md) to further understand how we structure goals, questions, and metrics.
Review [GQM use cases and user journeys](./measuring/gqm_example/README.md) to guide their development.

We document goals, questions, and metrics in separate folders in the [measuring](./measuring) directory.
You can browse all goals, questions, and metrics in [graph format](./measuring/use_gqm.md). 

Add in your own scenarios to the graph!
See the ["Metrics" section of CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#metrics).

a non-profit foundation where dozens of companies are already sharing experiences and working to
improve their craft of InnerSource.
