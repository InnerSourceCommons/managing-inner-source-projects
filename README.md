This book is intended to bring, from a managerial perspective, the several aspects needed
when introducing inner source methodologies into enterprises.

This book is a work in progress process where anyone is more than welcome to contribute
in any possible way. Ideas, comments, typos, full paragraphs or sections would be
great. This repository aims at bringing specialized knowledge from the industry
within this respect in a way that this is useful for third parties. For this, we are
actively looking for reviewers that can help in this process.
