# Comparing how inner-sourced your infrastructure is

Just detailing the infrastructure needed within an organization to effectively
apply InnerSource would be simplistic. This section aims at listing the
questions you need to ask to your infrastructure team to check if
that internal and well known infrastructure is able to be part of the
InnerSource process.

The goal of this section is to compare the internal infrastructure used within
an organization and check how close this is to an ideal InnerSource toolchain.
As detail, in the software development process, it is necessary the use of
specific tools such as the versioning system, code review process, ticketing
system, continuous integration, documentation storage and collaborative
platform to share technical decisions.

For each of those, we need to check if they are following the key aspects
provided such as openness.
