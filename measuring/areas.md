Areas of Analysis
=================

When analyzing software development projects, there are several areas
that can be analyzed. Traditional analysis are focused on code metrics,
while the activity, community and process are key components to take
into account. This handbook brings into context those areas not that
well studied, but key for InnerSource: community and process.

InnerSource is basically all about direct interactions between
developers, removing all of the hierarchical aspects remaining in the
middle. It is all about creating communities and building social
networks that allow the knowledge to fly around. InnerSource is about
leaving developers to work with other developers (D2D) jumping over the
traditional hierarchies. This helps to increase the development
activity, break silos of information and allow innovation within the
organization.

-   **Activity**: this component focuses on the basics. Any developer
    when interacting with the infrastructure of the organization leaves
    traces of activity. From commits to emails, from tickets activity to
    code review actions. Any of these traces is potentially measurable
    and many of these traces from a lot of developers display an
    organization chart with trends information. Measuring activity means
    quantifying the basic traces left by the developers. And when this
    information is aggregated and calculated over time, it is possible
    to obtain trends about this type of information. Usual activity
    measurements can be the number of commits up to some date, but also
    the increase or decrease of such number of commits when comparing to
    timeframes. This can be extended to any potential *event* that may
    take place in a community of developers: emails, reviews, opening a
    ticket, closing a ticket, commenting on a code review or sending an
    email, but there are others more elaborated such as actions as
    mentor, newcomers activity, cross-referenced information like
    tickets referencing pull requests and those referencing commits,
    etc.

-   **Community**: people are key when talking about InnerSource. If
    one of the goals consists of flattering the hierarchical structure
    of an organization, we need to measure how people interact with
    other developers. Although this is again measured through the traces
    left by the developers, the analysis proposed are pretty focused on
    the people and how they build their own social networks. As each
    developer has her own interests, it is necessary to understand how
    developers are attracted and retained in a project. What policies
    are more successful than others when attracting those and who are
    leaders in the software development process. Usual measurements in
    this case are related to the analysis of the contributors funnel
    coming to an internal project, effectiveness of specific policies to
    attract developers (e.g., hackathons) and others more specialized
    such as territoriality (how territorial a developer is) or
    betweenness if we play with some indicators when building networks.

-   **Process**: thus we have a community of developers working together
    and leaving traces of their activity. But InnerSource is something
    more than spreading the knowledge across the organization. It is
    also a matter of reducing the time to market, increasing the
    velocity of development and building better products. That is the
    reason why process is also a needed area of analysis. Process can be
    defined as the bureaucracy followed by the developers to write a
    piece of code. In a more hierarchical structure, there might be some
    daily meetings where some decisions are taken and requirements
    implemented. That is process and if we want to improve that, we need
    to measure in first place key parameters of such process. In Inner-
    Source communities, process is quite similar to open source
    communities where code style, documentation, code review process,
    continuous integration, design meetings are part of this process.
    The main difference here is how developers directly interact with
    other developers, even being from different business units, even
    been far away geographically. That interaction is the one we need to
    polish and improve if we want to increase the quality and velocity
    of the development process. Indeed the ideal goal when improving
    process is that the total process takes exactly 0 seconds. Once a
    piece of code comes out of the developers minds, this works, and can
    be automatically deployed. How can we reach that situation? I do not
    know, but hey!, at least we can measure that and check how far we
    are from heaven.

-   **Code**: this aspect of the analysis is probably a well known one.
    There are usual metrics that determine the complexity of the code,
    modularity, test coverage, documentation coverage, and others. What
    we have when measuring this type of metrics is that we can control
    where our InnerSource method is leading those metrics. Increases in
    the code complexity or less test coverage may indicate unexpected
    behaviors that should be fixed and controlled.
