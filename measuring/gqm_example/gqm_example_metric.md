# Example Metric

**A short name of the metric**

A brief description of the metric.

- **Synopsis**: Brief summary of the metric
- **Scale/UoM**: What is the scale and unit of measure of the metric? (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio - the scale limits the types of operations you can do. E. g. you can't compute averages on a nominal scale, even if the ordinals are expressed as numbers)
- **Interpretation**: What do different values or value ranges mean? (good/bad, little/a lot, ...)
-**Measuring**: How do you actually calculate the value of the metric and  what are the input sources (I think that is what _pseudo-code_ is referring to, below).
