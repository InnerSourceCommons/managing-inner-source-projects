# **Metric:** Number of InnerSource repositories

As projects adopt InnerSource, there are signs of such adoption on the corresponding source code repositories.
Examples are the presences of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, a "How to Contribute" section on the `README.md` file or repository topics in GitHub such as `innersource`.

One challenge with this metric, is defining what an InnerSource repository is, as there is no clear cut for this definition.
Some companies may have strict requirements for what an InnerSource repository is, others may adopt a _self-declaration_.

Another challenge is that companies that use (entirely or partially) the concept of a monorepo may need to find a different unit of measure to observe, as a single repository may be used for many projects or software packages.

**Synopsis**: Number of source code repositories that adopt InnerSource 

**Unit of Measurement**: Number of repositories 

**Interpretation**: Comparing an absolute number to a range does not make sense here. Comparing percentages (e.g. 10% of repositories are InnerSource) would make sense, but there is no strong base for comparison at the moment. What is more interesting for this metric is to observe its trend (how it changes over time).  

**Measuring**

Examples:
- Measure the number of GitHub repositories that have the topic `innersource` assigned to them.
- Measure the number of repositories that are above a given threshold on automated maturity score calculation
