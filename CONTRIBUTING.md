# How to contribute

This book is built as a [Gitbook book](https://gitbook.com). This is written
using [Markdown syntax](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gitbookio/markdown/).
This is maintained under the [InnerSource Commons' GitHub account](https://github.com/innersourcecommons) in the
[Managing Inner Source Projects repository](https://github.com/innersourcecommons/managing-inner-source-projects).

Thus you can follow the usual contribution process in GitHub through
[Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). You can
see for instance the pull requests open and closed at this point in time and for
this repository at https://github.com/innersourcecommons/managing-inner-source-projects/pulls .

If you want to share an idea, comment or feature request, you can also open an issue
in the [GitHub issues tracking for this repository](https://github.com/innersourcecommons/managing-inner-source-projects/issues).

Please be aware that all of your contributions will be opened by default and
that those will be licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Guidelines

When using titles in Markdown, use # for main title, ## for the second header title, etc. It's just to follow the same style :).
