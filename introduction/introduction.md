# Introduction

It was 2011 when Marc Andreessen wrote his famous article, “Why Software
is eating the World”[^1]. By that time, Linux Kernel was already 20
years old, developed under an open collaborative model by hundreds of
developers from different companies, and some even contributing during
their spare time. Linux can be found in almost any kind of device, from
IoT and car components, to super computing cloud hardware, without
forgetting one of the most used mobile operating systems in the market.

And Linux is just one example of how a free, open source software (OSS)
project has evolved from one single idea in one single person’s head to
multiple applications in many different fields and sectors. Each
application has improved it over time, thanks to its open collaborative
development methodology.

Almost 6 years later, we can assure that free, open source software
(OSS) projects have succeed in the IT development ecosystem. We can see
companies adopting OSS technologies and people contributing to OSS from
different companies and even during their spare time.

How has OSS reached the level of innovation we have nowadays? How has it
reached the market acceptance we see nowadays? How has it engaged so many
people and organizations to contribute to it?

It’s a teamwork effort and quoting John Wooden (former UCLA Bruins
basketball coach) in IBM Linux comercial [^2]:

“A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player.
Losing yourself in the group for the good of the group, that’s
teamwork.”

Since the collaboration methodologies used in OSS projects are providing
high quality innovative technology thanks to engaged development communities, 
why not applying same methodologies inside your company? That's inner source!

If you haven't decided yet to apply inner source in your company, we recommend you
start reading "Getting Started with InnerSource"[^3] by Andy Oran. After that, or if
you have already decided to start the inner source path, this book will give you better
understanding of Inner Source scenarios, framework and management skills.

## The Digital Transformation hype

During the same period of time, many companies have started facing what
they call their “Digital Transformation”, to become software omnichannel
companies[^4]. They become heavy IT users and the key transformation
steps usually are defined by

-   breaking cross-organizational silos (cultural change)

-   adoption new IT technologies (cloud, big data, mobile, etc.)

The adoption of these technologies usually means that companies need 
to build strong and competent “DevOps”[^5] teams.
Yes, “DevOps”, the second hype-word after “Digital Transformation” of
these ages.

“DevOps teams” share some principles with collaborative development
teams in the open source world. As first described by John Willis and
Damon Edwards in 2010, CALMS, standing for Culture (collaboration),
Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing to describe the “DevOps
framework”, obviously contains terms familar to any open source
developer.

These teams usually develop custom software solutions and deployment
recipes for their companies. For small, medium enterprises (SME) this
could be useful and easy to manage. But, what happens when the company
has several DevOps teams around the world? How can they ensure a maximum
code/knowledge reuse across the organization?

We have seen companies facing the same problem with different solutions
due to the lack of cross-organizational transparent and collaborative
methodology.

## The World of Silos

In some cases, there is a corporate head or central unit that decides
the technology for the rest of business units. When these business units
adopt the technology, they usually need to customize it, ending with
something slightly different to the orginal product. While the central
unit evolves its product in their “closed silo”, the other units are
probably doing the same in their “silos”. The result? The adoption of
any update of the “core product” is a nightmare.

In other cases, business units behave as independent companies. Each one
uses their own IT architecture, ending with an inefficient management of
resources caused by multiplication of technologies, developments, etc.

Collaborative development in open source ecosystems has been used several
times as an example of how these methodologies can break silos between
companies that might be even market competitors. Those companies have
been able to share knowledge and resources with a common goal . If competitors can
collaborate to build technology in which their business rely on, why
could not corporate business units do the same if they have corporate
succes as mission?

## The start-ups bubble

Many people might discuss if we are living a “start-ups bubble” or not,
but we are clearly surrounded by news about how a group of few people go
from a garage to a multinational company in a few years through
investment rounds.

Our experience tell us that opening offices abroad is always a
challenge, and managing development teams growing that fast can be a
serious problem.

The lack of effective and transparent communication channels and
documented procedures, might make harder any new employee on-boarding
and to be engaged with the company.

On the other hand, recently created companies have been born taking
advantage of the existing IT solutions to provide omnichannel services.
They are used to work under “DevOps culture” and it might be easier for
them to adopt a common cross-organizational methodology that allow
transparency and collaboration.

## Disengagement at work

If previous scenarios are familiar to you, probably you don’t feel
engaged at work. Don’t worry, you are not alone. According to World
Economic Forum [^6] 70% of employees say they are disengaged at work.

In the same article, it says that “Research from the University of
California found that motivated employees were 31% more productive, had
37% higher sales, and were three times more creative than demotivated
employees. They were also 87% less likely to quit, according to a
Corporate Leadership Council study on over 50,000 people”.

Towers Watson[^7] found that companies with engaged employees produced
19.2% more operative incomes in one year, but companies with worse
engagement operative incomes get reduced by 32.7%.

It was Daniel Pink in his book "Drive"[^8] who argues that human motivation is 
largely intrinsic. The aspects of this motivation can be divided into 

- autonomy, typical for OSS projects developers that are self-managed

- mastery, as the desire to improve developer skills to improve the project they are involved in

- purpose, defined as mission in many OSS projects

These aspects are key for software developers motivation, since their tasks
involve cognitive skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking.

## Adopting OSS development principles

Briefing, there are several scenarios found in companies with an strong
IT factor:

-   “Silos Culture” avoiding cross-organizational transparency

-   Inefficient resources management

-   Disengagement at work

By adopting OSS development principles, companies are adopting:

-   Governance model with policies to self-manage their projects under a
    collaborative methodology

-   Transparent communication channels to break silos

-   Meritocracy, or do-cracy, for developers, who become engaged “contributors” 
    (autonomous, willing to improve their skills and focused in project purpose)

-   New roles for project managers, empowering their soft skills for
    people/community management

These principles will help the companies on:

-   Effective resources management, with better code/knowledge reuse
    and cost sharing accross the different units

-   Faster technology innovations/improvements, since the code is
    developed collaboratively and transparently by interested people and
    units

-   Empowered employees, increasing engagement by letting them to be
    part of companies development roadmap

-   Higher inner-innovation, by allowing employees to propose new ideas
    implementation based on company’s technology/knowledge

Adopting OSS development principles inside your company is the main
definition for Inner Source or Inner Sourcing. If you have already
decided, or have started to adopt Inner Source in your company, this
book will provide you some insights about how you can track the status
of your path.
