# Inner source framework

Adopting inner source methodology help companies on:

-   Effective resources management, with better code/knowledge reuse
    and cost sharing accross the different units

-   Faster technology innovations/improvements, since the code is
    developed collaboratively and transparently by interested people and
    units

-   Empowered employees, increasing engagement by letting them to be
    part of companies development roadmap

-   Higher inner-innovation, by allowing employees to propose new ideas
    implementation based on company’s technology/knowledge

But any project, even open source ones, need a framework
that support them defining:

-   clear policies for contributors, to manage meritocracy (or do-cracy)

-   tools and communication channels

-   community culture

-   who pays it?

-   metrics and KPIs

Let's introduce the *inner source framework*.

## Governance

As described by OSSWatch[^1]:

>A governance model describes the roles that project participants 
>can take on and the process for decision making within the project. 
>In addition, it describes the ground rules for participation in the 
>project and the processes for communicating and sharing within 
>the project team and community

Usually the governance model is a written document containing:

-  project goals

-  work, management and collaboration infrastructures definition

-  people roles and responsabilities definitions

-  community support mechanisms 

-  decision making process policies description

-  contribution process policies description

-  monitoring policies and mechanisms description

## Technical infrastructure

## Collaboration as cultural change

## Finnancial support

## Processes measurement

>is the first step toward community.” – Henry Lewis Gates (professor at
